For this implementation project, you may use `networkx <https://networkx.github.io/>`_ in Python or `igraph <https://igraph.org>`_ in Python and R.

Network Properties for Ecoli
==============================

Download the file `<Ecoli.txt>`_ that gives the gene network for E.Coli. It
has an (undirected) edge whenever there is an interaction between the
two genes.

Write an script to compute several of the graph properties for the E.coli network:

* *Diameter*: Compute the diameter. Note that normally, $d_{ij}$,
  the distance (shortest path length) between node $i$ and $j$, is
  considered to be infinity if $i$ cannot reach $j$. For this
  assignment, simply ignore $d_{ij}$ if $i$ cannot reach $j$. In
  other words, compute the diameter as the maximum $d_{ij}$ over all
  reachable pairs $i$ and $j$. *Note*: do not use the builtin
  *diameter* function in networkx/igraph. However you may compute the
  shortest paths using the *shortest paths* functions.

* *Degree Distribution*: Print the degree distribution of the Ecoli
  network. Next, plot the degree $k$ and the probability $P(k)$ in a
  log-log plot to see whether the plot looks like a straight line. Use
  the linear regression function to fit a line to the log-log data, and
  plot the line and print its slope, corresponding to the exponent in
  the power-law degree distribution: :math:`P(k) \propto k^{âˆ’\gamma}`. You
  may omit the first few and last few degree values to get a better fit.
  Use your judgement to get a "good" fit. *Note*: do not use the
  builtin degree distribution related functions.

* *Clustering Coefficient*: Compute the clustering coefficient for
  the graph. If a node has degree less than 2, assume that its local
  clustering coefficient is 0. *Note*: do not use the builtin
  *transitivity*, or *clustering coefficient*, or related functions.

Page Rank in E. Coli
==========================

Download the file `<Ecoli-directed.txt>`_ that gives the gene regulatory
network for E.Coli. It has a directed edge from gene $u$ to gene
$v$, if $u$ controls $v$. Create a directed graph from these
edges.

Compute the pagerank for each gene, via the power-iteration method,
assuming that $d=0.1$, that is with probability 0.1 we follow a random
link, and with probability 0.9 an existing link from each node. That is
write a function to find the dominant eigenvector and eigenvalue for the
pagerank matrix of the directed Ecoli graph. One can compute the
dominant eigen-vector/-value of a matrix :math:`\mathbf{M}` iteratively
as follows. 

Let :math:`\mathbf{x}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1\\ \vdots \\ 1
\end{pmatrix}` be the starting vector. In each iteration $i$, we compute
the new vector:

.. math::
    
    \mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{M} \; \mathbf{x}_{i-1}

We then find the element of :math:`\mathbf{x}_i` that  has the maximum
absolute value, say at index $m$. For the next round, to avoid numerical
issues with large values, we re-scale :math:`\mathbf{x}_i` by dividing
all elements by :math:`\mathbf{x}_{im}`, so that the largest value is
always 1 before we begin the  next 	iteration. To test convergence, you
may test the magnitude of the difference between the old and new scaled
vector, i.e., :math:`\|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_{i-1}\|`,  and you can
stop if the difference between these two falls below some threshold, say
0.001.

Run your iterative dominant eigensolver on the Ecoli-directed dataset.
Find the dominant eigen-value and eigen-vector. For the final
eigen-vector, make sure to normalize it, so that it has unit length.
Print the top 10 genes according to pagerank. Note: do not use the
builtin **page rank**  or **eigen** methods.
