Download the datafile *adult.data* from the `UCI Machine Learning Repository <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult>`_. This is a selection of the Census data from
1994, and it has 48842 instances over 14 categorial, real and integer
attributes.

Compute the contingency matrix for variables *education* and
*race*, and compute the :math:`\chi^2` statistic using your own
function, i.e., write a function that takes as input two categorical
column-vectors, and returns the :math:`\chi^2` value and its p-value.  At
the 99% confidence level, are *education* and *race*
dependent?
