<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The fundamental algorithms in data mining and analysis form the basis
for the emerging field of data science, which includes automated methods
to analyze patterns and models for all kinds of data, with applications
ranging from scientific discovery to business intelligence and
analytics. This textbook for senior undergraduate and graduate data
mining courses provides a broad yet in-depth overview of data mining,
integrating related concepts from machine learning and statistics. The
main parts of the book include exploratory data analysis, pattern
mining, clustering, and classification. The book lays the basic
foundations of these tasks, and also covers cutting-edge topics such as
kernel methods, high-dimensional data analysis, and complex graphs and
networks. With its comprehensive coverage, algorithmic perspective, and
wealth of examples, this book offers solid guidance in data mining for
students, researchers, and practitioners alike.</p>

<h1>Reviews &amp; Endorsements</h1>
<p><em>This book by Mohammed Zaki and Wagner Meira, Jr. is a great option for
teaching a course in data mining or data science. It covers both
fundamental and advanced data mining topics, explains the mathematical
foundations and the algorithms of data science, includes exercises for
each chapter, and provides data, slides and other supplementary material
on the companion website.</em></p>

<p><em>World-class experts, providing an encyclopedic coverage of all data
mining topics, from basic statistics to fundamental methods (clustering,
classification, frequent itemsets), to advanced methods (SVD, SVM,
kernels, spectral graph theory). For each concept, the book thoughtfully
balances the intuition, the arithmetic examples, as well the rigorous
math details. It can serve both as a textbook, as well as a reference
book.</em></p>
