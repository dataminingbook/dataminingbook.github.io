<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The fundamental algorithms in data mining and machine learning form the
basis of data science, utilizing automated methods to analyze patterns
and models for all kinds of data in applications ranging from scientific
discovery to business analytics. This textbook for senior undergraduate
and graduate courses provides a comprehensive, in-depth overview of data
mining, machine learning and statistics, offering solid guidance for
students, researchers, and practitioners. The book lays the foundations
of data analysis, pattern mining, clustering, classification and
regression, with a focus on the algorithms and the underlying algebraic,
geometric, and probabilistic concepts. New to this second edition is an
entire part devoted to regression methods, including neural networks and
deep learning.</p>
<p>This second edition has the following new features and content:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>New part five on regression: contains chapters on linear regression,
logistic regression, neural networks (multilayer perceptrons), deep
learning (recurrent and convolutional neural networks), and regression
assessment.</p></li>
<li><p>Expanded material on ensemble models in chapter 24.</p></li>
<li><p>Math notation has been clarified, and important equations are now
boxed for emphasis throughout the text.</p></li>
<li><p>Geometric view emphasized throughout  the text, including for regression.</p></li>
<li><p>Errors from the first edition have been corrected.</p></li>
</ul>
