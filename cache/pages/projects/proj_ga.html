<h1>Network Properties for Ecoli</h1>
<p>Download the file <a class="reference external" href="Ecoli.txt">Ecoli.txt</a> that gives the gene network for E.Coli. It
has an (undirected) edge whenever there is an interaction between the
two genes.</p>
<p>Write an script to compute several of the graph properties for the E.coli network:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Diameter</em>: Compute the diameter. Note that normally, $d_{ij}$,
the distance (shortest path length) between node $i$ and $j$, is
considered to be infinity if $i$ cannot reach $j$. For this
assignment, simply ignore $d_{ij}$ if $i$ cannot reach $j$. In
other words, compute the diameter as the maximum $d_{ij}$ over all
reachable pairs $i$ and $j$. <em>Note</em>: do not use the builtin
<em>diameter</em> function in networkx/igraph. However you may compute the
shortest paths using the <em>shortest paths</em> functions.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Degree Distribution</em>: Print the degree distribution of the Ecoli
network. Next, plot the degree $k$ and the probability $P(k)$ in a
log-log plot to see whether the plot looks like a straight line. Use
the linear regression function to fit a line to the log-log data, and
plot the line and print its slope, corresponding to the exponent in
the power-law degree distribution: <span class="math">\(P(k) \propto k^{-\gamma}\)</span>. You
may omit the first few and last few degree values to get a better fit.
Use your judgement to get a &quot;good&quot; fit. <em>Note</em>: do not use the
builtin degree distribution related functions.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Clustering Coefficient</em>: Compute the clustering coefficient for
the graph. If a node has degree less than 2, assume that its local
clustering coefficient is 0. <em>Note</em>: do not use the builtin
<em>transitivity</em>, or <em>clustering coefficient</em>, or related functions.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Page Rank in E. Coli</h1>
<p>Download the file <a class="reference external" href="Ecoli-directed.txt">Ecoli-directed.txt</a> that gives the gene regulatory
network for E.Coli. It has a directed edge from gene $u$ to gene
$v$, if $u$ controls $v$. Create a directed graph from these
edges.</p>
<p>Compute the pagerank for each gene, via the power-iteration method,
assuming that $d=0.1$, that is with probability 0.1 we follow a random
link, and with probability 0.9 an existing link from each node. That is
write a function to find the dominant eigenvector and eigenvalue for the
pagerank matrix of the directed Ecoli graph. One can compute the
dominant eigen-vector/-value of a matrix <span class="math">\(\mathbf{M}\)</span> iteratively
as follows.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1\\ \vdots \\ 1
\end{pmatrix}\)</span> be the starting vector. In each iteration $i$, we compute
the new vector:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{M} \; \mathbf{x}_{i-1}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We then find the element of <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}_i\)</span> that  has the maximum
absolute value, say at index $m$. For the next round, to avoid numerical
issues with large values, we re-scale <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}_i\)</span> by dividing
all elements by <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}_{im}\)</span>, so that the largest value is
always 1 before we begin the  next      iteration. To test convergence, you
may test the magnitude of the difference between the old and new scaled
vector, i.e., <span class="math">\(\|\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_{i-1}\|\)</span>,  and you can
stop if the difference between these two falls below some threshold, say
0.001.</p>
<p>Run your iterative dominant eigensolver on the Ecoli-directed dataset.
Find the dominant eigen-value and eigen-vector. For the final
eigen-vector, make sure to normalize it, so that it has unit length.
Print the top 10 genes according to pagerank. Note: do not use the
builtin <strong>page rank</strong>  or <strong>eigen</strong> methods.</p>
