<p>Implement the CHARM algorithm for frequent closed itemset mining (see Algorithm 9.2 in chapter 9). Download the file <a class="reference external" href="mushroom.txt">mushroom.txt</a> for your runs. Each line of the file contains a transaction, i.e., as set of items that occur together. The transactions do not have to be of the same length, but you may assume that each line will be sorted on the items.</p>
<p>Your script should accept the filename and minimum support value from the command line. It should be run as: ScriptName mushroom.txt MINSUP. Here MINSUP is in absolute numbers.</p>
<p>Your script should output all the frequent closed itemsets in the following format:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">closed itemset - support</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>with one itemset and its support per line. It should also print the total number of frequent closed itemsets on the last line of the output.</p>
<p>Run your code on mushroom.txt for two different values of minsup, namely minsup = 5000, and minsup = 3000, and record the output.</p>
