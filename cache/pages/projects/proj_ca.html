<h1>Paired t-Test and Bayes Classifier</h1>
<p>Download the datafile <em>iris.data</em> from the <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris">UCI Machine Learning
Repository</a>. This has
five attributes with 150 instances. The last column of the data
is a categorical attribute for the class of Iris flower.</p>
<p>In this assignment you will evaluate the performance of the Full Bayes
and Naive Bayes classifier on the iris dataset.
You have to assess via the paired t-test whether the classifiers are
significantly different or not.</p>
<p>You will implement Algorithm 22.4 in chapter 22, except that instead of
the K-fold cross validation, use K rounds of bootstrap resampling (as
described in Algorithm 22.3:lines 1-4). For each bootstrap sample
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{D}_i\)</span> you need to learn the paramerers of the Bayes
classifiers -- full and naive -- and then test on <span class="math">\(\mathbf{D} \setminus
\mathbf{D}_i\)</span> and record the error rates. Finally tabulate the
difference in the performance of the full and naive Bayes classifier for
each round. From the difference values in each of the <span class="math">\(K\)</span> rounds
compute the <span class="math">\(z\)</span>-score value (line 9; Algorithm 22.4) and then test if
the two classifiers are different or not at <span class="math">\(\alpha=0.95\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\alpha=0.99\)</span> confidence level. Use <span class="math">\(K=30\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that the only difference between the full and naive Bayes
classifier is that the former uses the full covariance matrix, whereas
the latter uses a diagonal one.</p>
<p>You should implement the Bayes classifiers on your own, but you may use
builtin functions to find out the critical values for the t-distribution
for a given confidence level <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>. <em>Note</em>: In python you will
find <em>scipy.stats</em> module useful for this; in R, you may use <em>qt</em>).</p>
