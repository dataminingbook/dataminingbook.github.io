<p>Download the datafile <em>adult.data</em> from the <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>. This is a selection of the Census data from
1994, and it has 48842 instances over 14 categorial, real and integer
attributes.</p>
<p>Compute the contingency matrix for variables <em>education</em> and
<em>race</em>, and compute the <span class="math">\(\chi^2\)</span> statistic using your own
function, i.e., write a function that takes as input two categorical
column-vectors, and returns the <span class="math">\(\chi^2\)</span> value and its p-value.  At
the 99% confidence level, are <em>education</em> and <em>race</em>
dependent?</p>
