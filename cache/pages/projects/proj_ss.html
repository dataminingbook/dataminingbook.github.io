<p>Your goal here is to write a program that obtains the support of a list of sequences, in a sequence database.</p>
<p>The program should take as input the following two files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>FILE1: A list of sequences (one per line) that comprise the
dataset. See the file: <a class="reference external" href="sequencedb.txt">sequencedb.txt</a>. Lines beginning with '&gt;' are comments, but serve to demarcate one sequence from the next. You may assume that the alphabet will remain <span class="math">\(\Sigma = \{A,C,G,T\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>FILE2: A list of substrings (one per line), i.e., consecutive subsequences, whose supports have to be computed. See the file: <a class="reference external" href="seqin.txt">seqin.txt</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your program should output for each sequence in FILE2 the following info:</p>
<p>sequence - support</p>
