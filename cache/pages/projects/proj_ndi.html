<p>Your goal here is to write a program to compute whether an itemset is derivable or not. The program should take as input the following two files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>FILE1: A list of itemsets with their support values (one per line). See the file: <a class="reference external" href="itemsets.txt">itemsets.txt</a> (the format is &quot;itemset - support&quot;; one per line)</p></li>
<li><p>FILE2: A list of itemsets (one per line), whose support bounds have to be derived. See the file: <a class="reference external" href="ndi.txt">ndi.txt</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your program should output for each itemset in FILE2 the following
info:</p>
<p>itemset:     <em>[l,u]</em>      derivable/non-derivable</p>
<p>where l and u are the lower and upper-bounds on the support.</p>
